## Target DealBrowser

Tools:
Kotlin language - Because it's cool
Android Annotations - For simple projects this library is a good alterative instead of Dagger and Butterknife
ViewModel - For caching data, and accessing it from fragments
ShoeBoxes - A self made library which eases fragment navigation and keeps the app as a single activity
DataBinding - It glues data between views and presenter, and it's fun to use
